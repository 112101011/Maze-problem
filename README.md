# Maze Route Finder: AI Algorithms in Action

## Overview

This project explores how various AI algorithms can help a virtual mouse navigate a maze. The implementation showcases and compares different pathfinding techniques, including:

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- **A star Search with Different Heuristics**

### Features

- **Multiple Pathfinding Algorithms:** Implementations of BFS, DFS, and A* search, allowing for a comprehensive study of their efficiency and accuracy.
- **Heuristic Variants in A\* Search:** Several heuristic functions (e.g., Manhattan distance, Euclidean distance) are employed in A\* to observe their impact on the search process.
- **Performance Comparison:** The code includes tools to compare the algorithms' performance in terms of speed, path length, and computation time.

## Algorithms

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**
   - Explores the maze layer by layer, ensuring the shortest path in terms of edges, but not necessarily in terms of cost or distance.
   
2. **Depth-First Search (DFS):**
   - A backtracking-based approach that explores as far as possible along a branch before backtracking. It may not always find the optimal path.
   
3. **A star Search:**
   - An informed search algorithm that uses both the actual distance from the start and a heuristic to predict the remaining distance to the goal.
   - **Heuristics:**
     - **Manhattan Distance:** Optimizes for grid-based movement.
     - **Euclidean Distance:** Accounts for straight-line distance in open spaces.
     - **Custom Heuristics:** You can experiment with additional heuristics to fine-tune performance.

## Results

The results section of the code showcases detailed comparisons of the algorithms, highlighting:

- The paths generated by each algorithm.
- The computational cost and time taken.
- How different heuristics affect A* search performance.
